# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of this project is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to offset the many forms of inequality and bias that exist.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort, we encourage you to recognize their contributions. We will strive to be clear in our communication and take responsibility for our mistakes, but we also need your help.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your fellow community members.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment of any kind.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without their explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 5. Enforcement
